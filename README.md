# Etch-a-Sketch! ╰(*°▽°*)╯

This project was DIFFICULT. Actually, I've been lookin forward to this project for a while and I did NOT expect it to be this brain-melting. I still managed to do it, though.

I noticed how most people used nested for-loops to create the rows and columns, but I achieved this with just a single for-loop! \^o^/

I struggled with resizing the canvas for a while (because I suck at math), and I felt INCREDIBLY SMART after figuring that one out :]
